Piyush’s Perfect Ride to College (Moderate Coding)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem Description............

Piyush is a college student who lives far from his campus at point 0 on a long, straight road. His 
college is located at a specific point d, which is an integer distance away from his home. Every day, 
Piyush needs to find a vehicle that can get him to college on time while meeting specific conditions. 
• Piyush leaves his home every day at 8:00 AM 
• The college gates open and close at specific times during the day. These times are given as: 
     L: The earliest time the gates open, represented in 24 hr format. 
     R: The latest time the gates close, also represented in 24 hr format. 
• If Piyush arrives earlier than L or later than R, he cannot enter the college. 
• Piyush has n vehicles available to choose from. Each vehicle has a fixed speed (in kilometers 
per Hr), but vehicles only stop at positions that are integer multiples of their speed.
For example: 
- A vehicle with a speed of 5 will stop at distances 5, 10, 15, …, but not at any other 
points. 
• Piyush wants to select a vehicle that satisfies the following conditions: 
The vehicle must stop exactly at the college's position d. 
The vehicle must reach the college between L and R minutes from midnight (inclusive). 
Out of all valid options, Piyush prefers the vehicle with the minimum speed to ensure a comfortable ride. 
If no vehicle meets these criteria, Piyush will have to miss college for the day. 

Input Format.....................
1. The first line contains an integer d, the distance (in kilometers) between Piyush’s home and 
his college. 
2. The second line contains two integers L and R, representing the gate opening and closing 
times in 24 hr format. 
3. The third line contains an integer n, the number of vehicles available. 
4. The fourth line contains n integers, where each integer represents the speed (in kilometers 
per Hr) of a vehicle. 

Output Format.....................
Output the minimum speed of the vehicle that satisfies the conditions. If no vehicle meets all 
criteria, output -1. 

Constraints 
• 1 <= d <= 10^9 
• 8<= L, R <= 24 
• 1 <= n <= 10^5 
• 1 <= speed <=10^9

        int R = scanner.nextInt();  
  
        int L_minutes = L * 60;                           // Convert L and R to minutes
        int R_minutes = R * 60;  
  
        int n = scanner.nextInt();                        // Input number of vehicles

        int leaveTime = 480;                              // Piyush leaves at 8:00 AM, which is 480 minutes  
        int minSpeed = Integer.MAX_VALUE;  
 
        for (int speed : speeds) {                                                      // Check each vehicle 

            if (d % speed == 0) {                                                      // Check if the vehicle can stop at exactly distance d  
                int timeToReach = (d / speed) * 60;                                    // Calculate time to reach college in minutes  
                int arrivalTime = leaveTime + timeToReach;  

                if (arrivalTime >= L_minutes && arrivalTime <= R_minutes) {             // Check if arrival time is within the allowed range  
                    if (speed < minSpeed) {                                             // Check for minimum speed  
                        minSpeed = speed;  
                    }  
                }  
            }  
        }  

        if (minSpeed == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {                                              // Output the result  
            System.out.println(-1);  
        } else {  
            System.out.println(minSpeed);  
        }  

        scanner.close();  
    }  
}

Complexity:
The solution runs in O(n) time complexity, as we need to check each vehicle exactly once,
making it efficient for the given constraints.
